\# Modern CMS Platform - Product Requirements Document  

Generated: 2025-09-26 | Updated: 2025-09-26



\## Vision Statement  

Build a startup-friendly, SaaS-first headless CMS with best-in-class on-page visual editing, AI-assisted content authoring, and scalable content federation that grows with customers from startup to enterprise.



\## Business Context  

\- \*\*Target users and their pain points:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Content creators want immediate visual feedback and intuitive editing without technical friction.  

&nbsp; - Developers seek an extensible, API-first CMS with simplified infrastructure needs.  

&nbsp; - Growing businesses require personalization integrated with CDPs but avoiding complex AI infrastructure upfront.  

&nbsp; - Need for compliance, multi-language, collaboration, and version control without enterprise overhead initially.  

\- \*\*Market opportunity and constraints:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Rising demand for seamless omnichannel content delivery with personalized experiences.  

&nbsp; - Startups require a pragmatic architecture that supports fast MVP release and incremental upgrades.  

&nbsp; - Constraints include limited dev resources, need for simple yet extensible design, and latency minimization.  

\- \*\*Success metrics and timelines:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Launch MVP within 6 months delivering core editing, versioning, rule-based personalization, and SaaS deployment.  

&nbsp; - Achieve +8–12% conversion uplift on personalized content with validated A/B testing within 3 months post-launch.  

&nbsp; - Meet API p95 latency ≤ 300ms, uptime 99.9%, publish-to-live (p99) ≤ 10s.  

&nbsp; - Expand to content federation, real-time CDP integration, edge features, and advanced governance by 12–18 months.



\## Technical Architecture  

\- \*\*Recommended tech stack:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Backend monolith (Node.js or Go) with PostgreSQL and JSONB columns for flexible, versioned content storage.  

&nbsp; - React-based frontend for in-context visual editing powered by draft preview tokens linking DOM nodes to content entries.  

&nbsp; - AI personalization using LLM APIs (Google Gemini Flash, Azure OpenAI mini, etc.) routed for tagging, summarization, and editorial assistance.  

&nbsp; - SaaS cloud hosting initially; edge computing for personalization flags and A/B testing integrated in Phase 2+.  

\- \*\*Database schema requirements:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Postgres JSONB for content documents, supporting references, locales, and versioning with append-only history.  

&nbsp; - Analytics read replica or data warehouse sync planned in Phase 2.  

\- \*\*Third-party integrations needed:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Customer Data Platforms (Segment recommended initially) for real-time audiences and personalization gating.  

&nbsp; - Localization management systems (Lokalise, Phrase) for streamlined translation workflows.  

&nbsp; - Marketing and analytics integrations (Google Analytics, Mixpanel) via event webhooks and APIs.  

\- \*\*Performance and security requirements:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Initial p95 API latency target ≤ 300ms; 99.9% availability SLA.  

&nbsp; - OAuth2/JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC) as MVP baseline.  

&nbsp; - GDPR/CCPA compliance support via consent tracking and policy readiness.



\## Feature Breakdown (Atomic Level)



\### Core Features  

\- \*\*Content Modeling \& Visual Editing:\*\*  

&nbsp; - JSON-schema driven models editable through the UI.  

&nbsp; - On-page visual editing with draft preview tokens and DOM-to-content entry mapping, enabling immediate contextual feedback.  

&nbsp; - Version history with rollback and scheduled publish/expiry.  

\- \*\*AI Assistance:\*\*  

&nbsp; - LLM-powered auto-tagging, summaries, title suggestions, and variant draft generation.  

&nbsp; - Human-in-the-loop approval before publishing AI-generated content.  

\- \*\*Personalization v1:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Rule-based audience targeting (geo, device, custom flags) with exposure logging for A/B testing.  

&nbsp; - Edge flag assignment implemented with Vercel Edge Config/Cloudflare Workers and cookie persistence.  

&nbsp; - Stub integration with Segment for real-time audience sync.  

\- \*\*User \& Permission Management:\*\*  

&nbsp; - MVP role sets: Org Admin, Project Admin, Editor, Publisher, Viewer.  

&nbsp; - Field-level locks on critical metadata (slug, locale, SEO fields).  

\- \*\*Localization:\*\*  

&nbsp; - API support for localized content changes and translation workflow integration.



\### Nice-to-Have Features (Post-MVP)  

\- Content federation via lightweight proxy remote fields pulling external content with cache TTLs.  

\- Advanced CDP audience API integration for dynamic personalization gating and edge flag updates.  

\- Experimentation improvements with CUPED and fixed-horizon stats monitoring.  

\- Plugin marketplace with UI extensions and serverless backend hooks.  

\- Edge-cached content and signed asset URLs.



\## Development Phases



\- \*\*Phase 1:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Core content CRUD \& versioning API.  

&nbsp; - Visual editor with draft preview tokens.  

&nbsp; - LLM API-based authoring assistance.  

&nbsp; - Basic personalization rules \& A/B exposure logging.  

&nbsp; - SaaS deployment with p95 ≤ 300ms latency, 99.9% uptime SLA.



\- \*\*Phase 2:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Federation-lite content via remote fields and proxy queries.  

&nbsp; - Localization and translation platform integration.  

&nbsp; - Real-time CDP audience sync via Segment or alternatives.  

&nbsp; - Enhanced experimentation dashboard and edge flag features.



\- \*\*Phase 3:\*\*  

&nbsp; - ABAC and policy-as-code with OPA integration, enterprise SSO/SCIM.  

&nbsp; - Plugin architecture \& developer marketplace launch.  

&nbsp; - Edge caching and transformation, signed URLs, advanced AI personalization.



\## Questions to Resolve  

1\. Which LLM API providers best balance latency, cost, and editorial quality for tagging/summarization?  

2\. What real-time CDP audience APIs are fastest and easiest for a startup to integrate?  

3\. How can we safely expand from Postgres JSONB storage to analytics-ready replicas or warehouses?  

4\. What MVP role granularity and editing workflows minimize UX clutter but allow safe content governance?  

5\. How do we phase edge features (flag assignment, caching, personalization) to reduce deployment risks?
