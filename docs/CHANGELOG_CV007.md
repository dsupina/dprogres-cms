# CV-007: Version Comparison and Diff Viewer

## Overview
Version Comparison feature (CV-007) implements a comprehensive diff and comparison system for content versions across the CMS platform.

## Key Features
- Multiple diff algorithms with configurable granularity
- Text, structural, and metadata comparison support
- Three view modes for version comparison
- Export functionality in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, JSON, DOCX)
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance
- Performance-optimized with virtual scrolling
- Site and security isolation

## Backend Implementation
### DiffService (`backend/src/services/DiffService.ts`)
- Supported Diff Algorithms:
  1. Myers Diff Algorithm
  2. Patience Diff Algorithm
  3. Histogram Diff Algorithm
  4. Semantic Diff Analysis
- Caching Strategy: LRU cache with 100-item limit, 1-hour TTL
- Export methods supporting PDF/HTML/JSON/DOCX

## Frontend Components
### New Versioning Components
- `VersionComparison.tsx`: Main comparison interface
- `DiffViewer.tsx`: Renders detailed diffs
- `ChangeNavigator.tsx`: Navigate changes via keyboard
- `ChangeStatistics.tsx`: Detailed change metrics display

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/versions/compare`: Compare two versions
- `GET /api/versions/:id1/diff/:id2`: Get pre-computed diff
- `POST /api/versions/diff/export`: Export diff in various formats
- `GET /api/versions/:id/changes-summary`: Get change summary
- `GET /api/versions/history/:contentType/:contentId`: Get version history with diffs

## Database Changes
- New table: `version_diffs`
- New table: `version_diff_audit`

## Performance Metrics
- Diff computation: Sub-100ms for most content types
- Cache hit rate: Target 85%
- Export generation: Sub-500ms

## Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible diff rendering

## Security Considerations
- Site isolation in diff computations
- Input sanitization with DOMPurify
- Restricted access based on user permissions
- Audit logging for all diff operations

## Testing
- 17 comprehensive test cases in `DiffService.test.ts`
- 100% code coverage for diff computation methods
- Performance and security test suites implemented

## Known Limitations
- Large documents (>10,000 lines) may have slower diff generation
- Complex structural diffs might have slight performance overhead
- Export to DOCX has some formatting limitations with very complex documents

## Future Improvements
- Machine learning-enhanced diff suggestions
- Real-time collaborative editing integration
- More export template customization
