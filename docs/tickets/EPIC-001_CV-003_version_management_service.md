# CV-003: Version Management Service

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Content Versioning & Draft Preview System
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** TODO

## User Story
As a **backend developer**, I need a comprehensive service layer for version management, so that I can perform all version operations with proper business logic, validation, and transaction safety.

## Background
The version service is the core business logic layer that handles all version operations. It needs to manage complex workflows like publishing, reverting, and comparing versions while maintaining data integrity.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Create new versions with automatic numbering
- Retrieve version history with filtering options
- Publish drafts to live content
- Revert to previous versions
- Compare versions to generate diffs
- Manage version lifecycle (draft → published → archived)
- Handle concurrent editing scenarios

### Technical Requirements
- Database transaction support for critical operations
- Efficient query optimization
- Proper error handling and logging
- Service method composition
- Dependency injection ready
- Testable architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Version numbers increment automatically
- [ ] Publishing updates both version and main content atomically
- [ ] Reverting creates a new draft from historical version
- [ ] Concurrent edits are detected and handled
- [ ] Service methods return proper TypeScript types
- [ ] All operations are wrapped in appropriate transactions
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Unit test coverage exceeds 90%

## Implementation Details

### Core Service Methods

**Version Creation**
- `createVersion()` - Create new version with auto-numbering
- `createDraft()` - Specialized draft creation
- `autoSave()` - Lightweight auto-save version

**Version Retrieval**
- `getVersions()` - List all versions for content
- `getVersion()` - Get specific version details
- `getCurrentDraft()` - Get active draft
- `getPublishedVersion()` - Get live version

**Version Operations**
- `updateVersion()` - Modify existing draft
- `publishVersion()` - Promote draft to published
- `revertToVersion()` - Create new draft from old version
- `archiveVersion()` - Soft delete version
- `deleteVersion()` - Hard delete (admin only)

**Version Comparison**
- `compareVersions()` - Generate diff between versions
- `getVersionChanges()` - Summary of changes
- `getVersionTimeline()` - Historical timeline

**Utility Methods**
- `validateVersionData()` - Data validation
- `checkConcurrentEdit()` - Detect conflicts
- `mergeVersions()` - Combine changes
- `pruneOldVersions()` - Cleanup old auto-saves

## Testing Considerations
- Unit tests for each method
- Transaction rollback scenarios
- Concurrent operation testing
- Performance testing with many versions
- Error condition coverage

## Documentation Requirements
- Service API documentation
- Transaction boundaries documentation
- Error handling guide
- Performance optimization notes

## Dependencies
- CV-001: Database schema
- CV-002: TypeScript types
- Database connection pool
- Transaction manager
