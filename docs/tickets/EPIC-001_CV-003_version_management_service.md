# CV-003: Version Management Service

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Content Versioning & Draft Preview System
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS

## User Story
As a **backend developer**, I need a comprehensive service layer for version management, so that I can perform all version operations with proper business logic, validation, and transaction safety.

## Background
The version service is the core business logic layer that handles all version operations. It needs to manage complex workflows like publishing, reverting, and comparing versions while maintaining data integrity.

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS
⚠️ **SECURITY BLOCKERS** - Must be resolved before implementation:

1. **Site Isolation Enforcement** - Current VersionService doesn't validate site ownership before operations
   - **Risk**: Cross-site data access vulnerability
   - **Solution**: Add site_id validation to all service methods

2. **Missing Audit Logging** - No audit trail for security events
   - **Risk**: Compliance violations (GDPR, SOC2)
   - **Solution**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all version operations

3. **Input Sanitization Missing** - Version content not sanitized
   - **Risk**: XSS attacks through version content
   - **Solution**: Add input validation and sanitization layer

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Create new versions with automatic numbering
- Retrieve version history with filtering options
- Publish drafts to live content
- Revert to previous versions
- Compare versions to generate diffs
- Manage version lifecycle (draft → published → archived)
- Handle concurrent editing scenarios
- Auto-pruning of old auto-save versions
- Batch operations for bulk version management
- Advanced line-by-line content diffing
- Event system for version lifecycle hooks

### Technical Requirements
- Database transaction support for critical operations
- Efficient query optimization with proper indexing
- Proper error handling and logging
- Service method composition
- Dependency injection ready
- Testable architecture
- Multi-site isolation and security
- Performance monitoring and observability
- Caching layer for frequently accessed versions
- Memory-efficient handling of large content versions

### Security Requirements
- Site isolation validation for all operations
- Input sanitization and validation
- Audit logging for compliance (GDPR, CCPA, SOC2)
- Role-based access control integration
- PII detection and proper handling
- Cross-site attack prevention

### Performance Requirements
- Version creation latency: <100ms p95
- Version publishing latency: <500ms p95
- Support for large version histories (10k+ versions)
- Efficient pagination for version lists
- Memory streaming for large content
- Database connection pool optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Version numbers increment automatically
- [ ] Publishing updates both version and main content atomically
- [ ] Reverting creates a new draft from historical version
- [ ] Concurrent edits are detected and handled
- [ ] Service methods return proper TypeScript types
- [ ] All operations are wrapped in appropriate transactions
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Unit test coverage exceeds 90%

## Implementation Details

### Core Service Methods

**Version Creation**
- `createVersion()` - Create new version with auto-numbering and site validation
- `createDraft()` - Specialized draft creation with conflict detection
- `autoSave()` - Lightweight auto-save version with automatic pruning
- `createVersionBatch()` - Bulk version creation for efficiency

**Version Retrieval**
- `getVersions()` - List all versions for content with site isolation
- `getVersion()` - Get specific version details with security validation
- `getCurrentDraft()` - Get active draft with caching
- `getPublishedVersion()` - Get live version with performance optimization
- `getVersionsByUser()` - Get versions created by specific user
- `getVersionsInDateRange()` - Get versions within time period

**Version Operations**
- `updateVersion()` - Modify existing draft with optimistic locking
- `publishVersion()` - Promote draft to published with atomic transaction
- `revertToVersion()` - Create new draft from old version with audit logging
- `archiveVersion()` - Soft delete version with compliance tracking
- `deleteVersion()` - Hard delete (admin only) with security validation
- `bulkArchiveVersions()` - Bulk archive operations
- `transferVersions()` - Move versions between sites (admin only)

**Version Comparison**
- `compareVersions()` - Generate detailed diff between versions
- `getVersionChanges()` - Summary of changes with change type classification
- `getVersionTimeline()` - Historical timeline with activity logs
- `generateContentDiff()` - Line-by-line content comparison
- `calculateVersionMetrics()` - Performance and change metrics

**Security & Validation**
- `validateVersionData()` - Input validation and sanitization
- `validateSiteAccess()` - Site isolation enforcement
- `auditVersionOperation()` - Comprehensive audit logging
- `detectPII()` - PII detection in version content
- `sanitizeContent()` - Content sanitization for security

**Performance & Maintenance**
- `checkConcurrentEdit()` - Detect conflicts with timestamp comparison
- `mergeVersions()` - Combine changes with conflict resolution
- `pruneOldVersions()` - Cleanup old auto-saves with configurable retention
- `optimizeVersionStorage()` - Storage optimization for large histories
- `preloadVersionCache()` - Cache warming for frequently accessed versions
- `getVersionMetrics()` - Performance metrics and health indicators

**Event System**
- `registerVersionEventHandler()` - Register event listeners
- `emitVersionEvent()` - Emit version lifecycle events
- `onVersionCreated()` - Event hook for version creation
- `onVersionPublished()` - Event hook for version publishing
- `onVersionArchived()` - Event hook for version archival
