# CV-007: Version Comparison and Diff Viewer

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Content Versioning & Draft Preview System
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** TODO

## User Story
As a **content editor**, I want to compare two versions of content side-by-side and see exactly what changed, so that I can review modifications and make informed decisions about publishing.

## Background
When reviewing content changes, editors need to understand what was modified. A visual diff viewer makes it easy to spot changes, whether they're minor typos or major content restructuring. This is especially important for compliance and quality control.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Compare any two versions side-by-side
- Show inline differences with highlighting
- Display unified diff view option
- Navigate between changes quickly
- Show change statistics (added/removed/modified)
- Export diff as PDF or HTML
- Compare with published version by default
- Show metadata changes (title, SEO, etc.)

### Technical Requirements
- Efficient diff algorithm for large documents
- Syntax highlighting for rich text
- Responsive layout for mobile
- Performant with long documents
- Accessible markup for screen readers
- Print-friendly styles

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison displays correctly
- [ ] Unified diff view works as alternative
- [ ] Changes are color-coded (green=added, red=removed, yellow=modified)
- [ ] Navigation jumps between changes work
- [ ] Statistics show accurate counts
- [ ] Metadata changes displayed separately
- [ ] Performance acceptable for 50+ page documents
- [ ] Mobile view is usable
- [ ] Export generates readable PDF
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Implementation Details

### Diff Engine

**Diff Types**
- Text diff (line by line)
- Word diff (word by word)
- Character diff (character by character)
- Structural diff (for rich text/HTML)
- Metadata diff (for fields)

**DiffService Methods**
```typescript
interface DiffService {
  compareVersions(v1: Version, v2: Version): DiffResult;
  generateTextDiff(text1: string, text2: string): TextDiff;
  generateStructuralDiff(doc1: Document, doc2: Document): StructuralDiff;
  calculateChangeStats(diff: DiffResult): ChangeStatistics;
  exportDiff(diff: DiffResult, format: 'pdf' | 'html'): Buffer;
}
```

### UI Components

**VersionComparison Component**
```typescript
interface VersionComparisonProps {
  leftVersion: Version;
  rightVersion: Version;
  viewMode: 'side-by-side' | 'unified' | 'inline';
  highlightLevel: 'line' | 'word' | 'character';
  onNavigate: (changeIndex: number) => void;
}
```

**Visual Design**
- Split view with synchronized scrolling
- Gutter showing line numbers
- Mini-map for navigation
- Change indicators in scrollbar
- Collapsible unchanged sections

### Change Navigation
- "Next/Previous change" buttons
- Keyboard shortcuts (n/p)
- Change overview sidebar
- Jump to change dropdown
- Search within changes

### Change Statistics
```typescript
interface ChangeStatistics {
  totalChanges: number;
  linesAdded: number;
  linesRemoved: number;
  linesModified: number;
  charactersAdded: number;
  charactersRemoved: number;
  changePercent: number;
  majorChanges: string[]; // Summary of significant changes
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling for long documents
- Lazy loading of diff sections
- Web Worker for diff calculation
- Caching of computed diffs
- Progressive enhancement

## Testing Considerations
- Test with various document sizes
- Verify diff accuracy
- Test navigation features
- Responsive design testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Documentation Requirements
- User guide for comparing versions
- Keyboard shortcuts reference
- Export options documentation
- Understanding diff colors

## Dependencies
- CV-003: Version service
- Diff algorithm library
- PDF generation library
- Syntax highlighting library
