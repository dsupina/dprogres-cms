# CV-005: Auto-Save System

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Content Versioning & Draft Preview System
**Priority:** High
**Status:** TODO

## User Story
As a **content creator**, I want my work automatically saved at regular intervals, so that I never lose progress even if my browser crashes or internet connection drops.

## Background
Content creators often spend hours working on articles, only to lose everything due to browser crashes, network issues, or accidental navigation. An auto-save system will periodically save their work in the background, providing peace of mind and preventing data loss.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Automatically save content every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Save only when content has changed
- Show visual indicator when saving
- Allow manual trigger of auto-save
- Recover unsaved work on page reload
- Clean up old auto-saves automatically
- Handle concurrent editing gracefully

### Technical Requirements
- Minimal performance impact
- Debouncing to prevent excessive saves
- Conflict detection for multi-user editing
- WebSocket support for real-time sync
- Local storage fallback
- Efficient diff detection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Content auto-saves every 30 seconds when changed
- [ ] Save indicator shows current save status
- [ ] No saves triggered if content unchanged
- [ ] Manual save button works instantly
- [ ] Unsaved changes recovered after browser crash
- [ ] Only last 5 auto-saves kept per content
- [ ] Concurrent edit warning displayed
- [ ] Performance impact < 50ms per save
- [ ] Works offline with sync on reconnect

## Implementation Details

### Backend Service

**AutoSaveService Methods**
- `autoSave()` - Create auto-save version
- `getLatestAutoSave()` - Retrieve recent auto-save
- `hasUnsavedChanges()` - Check for unsaved work
- `cleanupOldAutoSaves()` - Remove old saves
- `detectConflict()` - Check for concurrent edits

### Frontend Implementation

**Auto-Save Hook**
```javascript
useAutoSave({
  interval: 30000,
  content: currentContent,
  onSave: (data) => saveToServer(data),
  onConflict: (conflict) => showConflictDialog(conflict)
})
```

**Save Status Indicator**
- "Saved" - All changes saved
- "Saving..." - Currently saving
- "Unsaved changes" - Changes pending
- "Offline - will sync" - No connection

### Conflict Resolution
1. Detect concurrent edits via version timestamps
2. Show conflict dialog with options:
   - Keep my changes
   - Keep their changes
   - Merge manually
3. Create conflict resolution version

### Performance Optimizations
- Diff-based saves (only send changes)
- Debouncing for rapid edits
- Background Web Worker for diffing
- IndexedDB for offline storage

## Testing Considerations
- Simulate browser crashes
- Test with slow connections
- Verify cleanup job
- Test conflict scenarios
- Load test with many users
- Offline/online transitions

## Documentation Requirements
- Auto-save configuration guide
- Conflict resolution documentation
- Recovery procedures
- Performance tuning guide

## Dependencies
- CV-003: Version service
- WebSocket infrastructure
- Frontend state management
