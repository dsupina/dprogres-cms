# Development Milestones & Lessons Learned

## Project Timeline

### Initial Setup (July 2024)
**Completed Features**:
- Monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Express + TypeScript backend
- React + Vite frontend
- PostgreSQL database with Docker
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens

**Lessons Learned**:
- Docker-compose simplifies development environment
- TypeScript from the start prevents many runtime errors
- Monorepo structure helps with shared types

---

### Core CMS Features (August 2024)
**Completed Features**:
- Posts CRUD with categories and tags
- Pages management with templates
- Media upload with file validation
- User roles (admin, author, editor)
- Rich text editor (Quill)

**Lessons Learned**:
- File upload size limits need coordination between Nginx, Express, and frontend
- Quill editor requires careful sanitization for security
- Slug generation needs uniqueness checks

**Known Issues Fixed**:
- Media upload failing for large files - increased limits to 50MB
- Duplicate slug creation - added unique constraint and validation

---

### Multi-Domain Support (September 2024)
**Completed Features**:
- Domain management system
- Site-specific content filtering
- Menu builder with drag-and-drop
- Domain verification workflow
- Site resolver middleware

**Lessons Learned**:
- Domain verification requires DNS record checks
- Multi-tenancy adds complexity to all queries
- Menu hierarchies need depth limits for UI consistency

**Technical Decisions**:
- Chose domain_id foreign keys over separate databases for simplicity
- Implemented soft domain filtering via middleware
- Limited menu depth to 3 levels for UX

- 17 comprehensive tests, all passing

**Security Blockers Resolved**:
1. Cross-site content access prevention
2. Input sanitization for all content
3. Comprehensive audit trail implementation
4. Secure preview token generation
5. Site isolation in diff computations

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Added indexes on frequently queried columns (slug, status, domain_id)
- Compound indexes for multi-column queries
- JSONB for flexible schema (pages.data, templates.schema)

### API
- Implemented pagination on list endpoints
- Added field selection to reduce payload size
- Caching headers for static content

### Frontend
- Lazy loading for admin routes
- React Query for intelligent caching
- Optimistic updates for better UX

---

## Security Implementations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT with separate access/refresh tokens
- Role-based middleware checks
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Input Validation
- Joi schemas for all mutable endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection in rich text content

### Rate Limiting
- Auth endpoints: 5 requests per minute
- Upload endpoints: 10 requests per minute
- General API: 100 requests per minute

---

## Testing Coverage

### Backend Testing
- Auth middleware tests
- Route handler tests
- Service layer tests
- Database utility tests

### Frontend Testing
- Component unit tests
- Integration tests for API calls
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Accessibility testing

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm test
cd backend && npm run test:coverage

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm test
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e
```

---

## Deployment Experiences

### Development Setup
```bash
docker-compose up --build
npm run dev  # Runs both frontend and backend
```

### Production Considerations
- Separate docker-compose.prod.yml for production
- Environment variable management
- Database migrations strategy needed
- SSL/TLS termination at Nginx level

## Planned Features & Architecture

### Content Versioning & Draft Preview System (Implemented September 2025)
**Implemented Components**:

#### Database Layer
- **content_versions** table: Store all content versions with JSONB for flexible data
- **version_comments** table: Support collaborative review workflows
- **preview_tokens** table: Secure, expiring preview links
- Version types: draft, published, archived, auto_save
- Unique constraints for current_draft and published_version

#### Backend Services
- **VersionService**: Core versioning operations (create, publish, revert, diff)
- **AutoSaveService**: Periodic content saving with cleanup
- **PreviewService**: Token generation and validation
- **CommentService**: Version-specific discussions
- RESTful API endpoints: `/api/versions`, `/api/preview`, `/api/autosave`

#### Frontend Components
- **VersionManager**: Main version control interface
- **DraftEditor**: Enhanced editor with auto-save
- **VersionComparison**: Side-by-side diff viewer
- **PreviewFrame**: Isolated preview rendering
- **AutoSaveIndicator**: Real-time save status

#### System Architecture
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for version data, diffs, and preview content
- **Background Jobs**: Auto-save cleanup, token expiration, analytics
- **Security**: Permission guards, token validation, content sanitization
- **Events**: version.created, version.published, preview.accessed

**Expected Benefits**:
- Foundation for visual editing system
- Safe content experimentation with rollback
- Collaborative review workflows
- Shareable preview links
- Auto-recovery from browser crashes

**Implementation Priority**:
1. Core versioning tables and API
2. Auto-save functionality
3. Preview token system
4. Version comparison UI
5. Comment system

---

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### High Priority
1. ~~**Content Versioning**: No history/rollback capability~~ (Planned for January 2025)
2. **Search**: No full-text search implementation
3. **Caching**: No Redis/caching layer
4. **Monitoring**: No APM or error tracking

### Medium Priority
1. **API Documentation**: Need OpenAPI/Swagger docs
2. **Webhook System**: For third-party integrations
3. **Batch Operations**: Bulk edit/delete functionality
4. **Import/Export**: Content migration tools

### Nice to Have
1. **Plugin System**: Extensibility framework
2. **GraphQL API**: Alternative to REST
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support
4. **AI Integration**: Content suggestions, auto-tagging

---

## Abandoned Approaches

### What Didn't Work
1. **Separate databases per domain**: Too complex for MVP
2. **GraphQL from start**: Overkill for current needs
3. **Microservices architecture**: Premature optimization
4. **Custom rich text editor**: Quill works well enough

### Why They Failed
- Over-engineering for initial requirements
- Added complexity without clear benefits
- Maintenance overhead too high
- Existing solutions were adequate

---

## Key Metrics & Performance

### Current Performance
- API Response Time: ~50-200ms (local)
- Build Size: Frontend ~500KB gzipped
- Database Queries: Optimized with indexes
- Memory Usage: ~100MB Node.js process

### Bottlenecks Identified
- Rich text rendering on large documents
- Menu builder with many items (>50)
- Media library with no pagination
- No CDN for static assets

---

## Lessons for Next Phase

### What Worked Well
- TypeScript everywhere prevents bugs
- Joi validation catches issues early
- React Query simplifies state management
- Docker makes deployment consistent

### What Needs Improvement
- Need better error handling and logging
- Documentation should be updated with code
- Test coverage needs to be higher (>80%)
- Performance monitoring from day one

### Recommendations Going Forward
1. Implement versioning before content grows
2. Add monitoring/observability stack
3. Create data migration scripts
4. Document API with OpenAPI spec
5. Add integration tests for critical paths
